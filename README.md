<h1>Style Transfer</h1>

<p>
  I am not much of a painter myself, but I love the way some painters use texture to develop a personal style for their art. For this project, I used a technique called style transfer, introduced by Gatys et al. in their paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf">“A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style”</a> to transform a photograph of a pumpkin so that it looked like it was a picture of a pumpkin painted by Vincent Van Gogh in the style of his famous master work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night">“The Starry Night”</a>. Mathematically, this project amounted to projecting the pumpkin image into the style space of the “Starry Night” with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_matrix">Gram Matrix</a>.
